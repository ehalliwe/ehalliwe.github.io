	<p>i'll backfill this, someday, with all of my non-cell service endeavours. i grew up skiing and camping in the canadian rockies and time away from civilization is my favourite non-building-related activity</p>

	<p>original plan was to summit A2 (centre, 3060 m), instead went to boundary peak (2870 m) due to changing conditions. mt athabasca (3491 m) & silverhorn (~3400 m) on right, hilda peak (3058 m) on left. </p>
