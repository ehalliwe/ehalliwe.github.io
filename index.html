	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I'm a Master's student at the University of Alberta. My research focuses on optical methods to better determine a satellite's position and orbit. I also lead a team developing scientific instruments to study electron microburst precipitation on-board NASA's RockSat-X Terrier-Malemute sounding rocket. During my BSc. in Engineering Physics (also at UofA), I built and operated nanosatellites with AlbertaSat, designed my own guitar pedals with the Pod/ICE Incubator, rocked out with the Engineering Physics Club, and developed a love for competitive dodgeball with the Lister Dodgeball League. On holidays, you'll find me (or not!) spending time in the Canadian Rockies, skiing (backcountry and resort), hiking, camping, or just enjoying the fresh air. </p>
