	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I'm a Master's student at the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html">University of Alberta</a> in <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/electrical-computer-engineering/index.html">Electrical Engineering</a>. My research explores the use of optical methods to determine a satellite's position and orbit. I also lead a team developing scientific instruments to study electron microburst precipitation on-board <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wallops/stem/rocksatx/">NASA's RockSat-X sounding rocket mission</a>. 
</p>

	<p>During my BSc. in Engineering Physics (also at UofA), I built and operated nanosatellites with <a href="https://albertasat.ca/">AlbertaSat</a>, designed my own guitar pedals with the Pod/<a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/innovation-creativity-entrepreneurship/index.html">ICE Incubator</a>, rocked out with the <a href="https://engphys.ca/">Engineering Physics Club</a>, and developed a love for competitive dodgeball with the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/listerdodgeballleague/">Lister Dodgeball League</a>. </p>

	<p>On holidays, you'll find me (or not!) spending time in the Canadian Rockies, skiing (backcountry and resort), hiking, camping, or just enjoying the fresh air. </p>
