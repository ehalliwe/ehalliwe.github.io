	<h1>about</h1>
	<p>my name is <a href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=erik+halliwell">erik halliwell</a>. i currently reside in <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-cold-record-environment-canada-1.7083387">edmonton</a>, on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">earth</a>. i'm completing my master's at <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html">ualberta</a> in <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/electrical-computer-engineering/index.html">electrical engineering</a>.</p>
	<p>in grad school, i've been spending time</p>
	<ul>
		<li>on my master's research, which explores the use of optical methods like <a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12877/128771P/Dual-purpose-SDA-compliant-optical-ground-station-and-laser-ranging/10.1117/12.3001892.short">satellite laser ranging </a> and <a href="https://spie.org/photonics-west/presentation/Orbit-determination-using-passive-optical-communication-observations/13355-61">laser communication systems </a> to do spacecraft orbit determination - trying to out-do radio-based systems by 5 order of magnitude</li>
		<li>with PEPPER-X - a team I led which flight-qualified two energetic particle precipitation scientific instruments on-board <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wallops/stem/rocksatx/">NASA's RockSat-X sounding rocket</a>. they'll now fly on the <a href="https://www.radicalsmission.ca/">$20MM RADICALS microsatellite</a> in 2027</li>
		<li>as the lead teaching assistant for the 4th-year computer engineering capstone course (and won two <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/graduate-studies/media-library/awards-and-funding/awards-documents/2024-gsta-announcement.pdf">awards</a> doing it)</li>
		<li>building and flying a LoRa-based communications system for a <a href="https://news.usask.ca/articles/colleges/2023/final-launch-a-success-in-student-space-training-program-at-usask.php">stratospheric weather balloon</a> which i tracked with APRS (callsign VA6CSC, mostly on 2m but sometimes 70cm)</li>
		<li>hucking backflips on skis with my friends and built an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/boner_media/">instagram page with 65k followers</a> in the process</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>before that, i was doing my undergrad at ualberta in engineering physics, and
	<ul>
		<li>created <a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2024/all2024/186/">open-source deployable solar panels</a> (flown on 3 satellites and soon a 4th)</li>
		<li>was a primary operator for alberta's first satellite, Ex-Alta 1, built by <a href="https://albertasat.ca/">AlbertaSat</a></li>
		<li>got involved with free-space optical communication systems by <a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2022/all2022/328/">building one</a> that implemented LDPC FEC to achieve BER <10e-6 in LEO-to-Earth levels of emulated turbulence</li>
		<li>worked for two summers at <a href="https://g2voptics.com/">G2V Optics</a> building LED-based solar simulator calibration tools
		<li>designed my own guitar pedals with the Pod/<a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/innovation-creativity-entrepreneurship/index.html">ICE Incubator</a>, winning best hardware hack at the 2021 ualberta hackathon</li>
		<li>drove 35 hrs to/from eastern canada to test a multispectral imager that <a href="https://www.seds.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sbxteams-copy-3-600x600.png">me and my friends built</a> on-board a canadian/french space agency balloon</li>
		<li>rocked out as the guitarist/band coodinator for the <a href="https://engphys.ca/">Engineering Physics Club</a></li>
		<li>got paid to run north america's largest competitive dodgeball league, the ualberta-residence-based <a href="https://www.instagram.com/listerdodgeballleague/">Lister Dodgeball League</a></li>
		<li>consumed ~25kg of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee">coffee</a> (yes, i tracked it)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>on holidays, i'll be out spending time in the canadian rockies, skiing (backcountry and resort), leading my slo-pitch team to their 4th ualberta intramurals title in a row, or browsing wikipedia with the goal of getting on jeopardy one day.</p>
