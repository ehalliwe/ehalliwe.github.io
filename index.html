	<h1>about</h1>
	<p>i was born on and currently reside on earth. i'm completing my master's at <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html">ualberta</a> in <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/electrical-computer-engineering/index.html">electrical engineering</a>.</p>
	<p>in grad school, i've been spending time</p>
	<ul>
		<li>on my master's research, which explores the use of optical methods and laser communication systems to do spacecraft orbit determination - trying to out-do radio-based systems by 5 order of magnitude</li>
		<li>with PEPPER-X - a team I led which flight-qualified two energetic particle precipitation scientific instruments on-board <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wallops/stem/rocksatx/">NASA's RockSat-X sounding rocket</a>. they'll now fly on the <a href="https://www.radicalsmission.ca/">$20MM RADICALS microsatellite</a> in 2027</li>
		<li>as the lead teaching assistant for the 4th-year computer engineering capstone course (and won two awards for it)</li>
		<li>building and flying a LoRa-based communications system for a stratospheric weather balloon which i tracked with APRS (VA6CSC, HAMs unite)</li>
		<li>hucking backflips on skis with my friends and built a 65k follower instagram page in the process</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>before that, i was doing my undergrad at ualberta in engineering physics, and
	<ul>
		<li>created open-source deployable solar panels (flown on 3 satellites and soon a 4th)</li>
		<li>was a primary operator for alberta's first satellite, Ex-Alta 1, built by <a href="https://albertasat.ca/">AlbertaSat</a></li>
		<li>got involved with free-space optical communication systems by building one that implemented LDPC FEC to achieve BER <10e-6 in LEO-to-Earth levels of emulated turbulence</li>
		<li>worked for two summers at <a href="https://g2voptics.com/">G2V Optics</a> building LED-based solar simulator calibration tools
		<li>designed my own guitar pedals with the Pod/<a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/innovation-creativity-entrepreneurship/index.html">ICE Incubator</a>, winning best hardware hack at the 2021 ualberta hackathon</li>
		<li>drove 35 hrs to/from eastern canada to test a multispectral imager that me and my friends built on-board a canadian/french space agency balloon</li>
		<li>rocked out as the guitarist/band coodinator for the <a href="https://engphys.ca/">Engineering Physics Club</a></li>
		<li>got paid to run north america's largest competitive dodgeball league, the ualberta-residence-based <a href="https://www.instagram.com/listerdodgeballleague/">Lister Dodgeball League</a></li>
		<li>consumed ~25kg of coffee (yes, i tracked it)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>on holidays, i'll be out spending time in the canadian rockies, skiing (backcountry and resort), leading my slo-pitch team to their ualberta intramural 4th title in a row, or browsing wikipedia with the goal of getting on jeopardy one day.</p>
