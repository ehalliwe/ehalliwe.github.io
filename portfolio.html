	<h1>portfolio</h1>

	<p>summary: i've built PCBs and wrote firmware/software that has gone to and worked in space, had fun with dinky hackathon tinker projects, made this ugly website, and created work that ended up being published in laser comms, satellite laser ranging, solar panels, and space weather research instruments</p>

	<p>this whole thing started when i joined our UofA cubesat team (AlbertaSat) back in high school, and cut my teeth in satellite operations and electrical systems before entering university. i got addicted to building things and am always on the lookout for my next rabbit hole to go down!</p>

	<p>if you're interested in a certain project for any reason, feel free to reach out and i'll be happy to share more specifics as not all my repos are public. projects are somewhat listed in chronological order</p>

			<td>rooftop suburban SatNOGS ground station</td>
			<td>making a VHF + UHF Rx-only satellite ground station using simple omni antennas (this is a v0, after all). once i get this up and running smoothly i will 3d print a rotator/gearbox, convert add the use of yagi(s) and probably throw a webcam up there too. gotta have something to hack on while i plunk away at my thesis</td>

			<td>fantasy football draft assistant</td>
			<td>mostly vibe coded, but it was a ton of fun to put screenshots of this into our group chat and roast people with a python script. integrates with sleeper leagues and contains a 10 GB scrape of all historical roster performance and injury data, does projections on strength of schedule.</td>

			<td>EFxbuild retreat Jan'25</td>
			<td>used a rpi4 with a gc camera with a telescopic lens to do pixel-height conversion via openCV - this last bit is WIP. did this on an entrepreneurfirst build retreat in calistoga in an afternoon with poor wifi. shoutout oleg in the photo and logan murray for the idea</td>
