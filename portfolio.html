	<h2>portfolio</h2>

	<p>summary: i've built PCBs and wrote firmware/software that has gone to space (and worked), had fun with dinky hackathon tinker projects, made this ugly website, and created work that ended up being published in laser comms, satellite laser ranging, solar panels, and space weather research instruments. this whole thing started when i joined our UofA cubesat team (AlbertaSat) back in high school, and cut my teeth in satellite operations and electrical systems before entering university. i got addicted to building things that worked (or didn't, either way it's fun) and am always on the lookout for my next rabbit hole to go down!</p>

	<p>if you're interested in a certain project for any reason, feel free to email/DM me and i'll be happy to share more specifics</p>
